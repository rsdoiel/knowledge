abstract: |-
  A standalone SQLite3-backed knowledge base for tracking projects, observations, and concepts across independent experiments in the rsdoiel/Laboratory workspace. Extracted from the harvey terminal agent's knowledge.go, this module provides a typed CRUD API (Open, AddProject, AddObservationWithSource, AddConceptWithIdentifier, Search, and related methods) plus UUID-based row identity and a SQL/ATTACH-based cross-machine merge tool, so other experiments and language-model harnesses can read and write structured observations directly instead of raw sqlite3 CLI inserts. Ships cmd/kb, a single "kb VERB ARGS" binary (matching the git/go command model) covering the full API with both human-readable and --json output, a merge verb for reconciling two databases that drifted independently, and a read-only interactive TUI browser for exploring projects, observations, and concepts.

About this software
===================

## knowledge 0.0.3

Adds JSON-L export/import: ExportJSONL/ImportJSONL in the knowledge package, plus `kb export [-project NAME] [-out PATH]` and `kb import [-in PATH]` verbs. A portable, no-file-access alternative to merge -- the resulting file can be pasted, emailed, or committed to git, then applied elsewhere with import. Projects/concepts are matched by name (existing local rows win), sources by identifier, observations and links by uuid, so re-importing the same file is a no-op.
